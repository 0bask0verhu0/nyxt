* Setting The Start Page
Setting the start page can easily be achieved in the following manner:

#+NAME: start-page-set
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setf *start-page-url* "about:blank")
#+END_SRC

* Creating your own Parenscript
You can call any parenscript within the browser through the convient
defparen, and defparenstatic macros. A really simple example below
shows how you could set the body with the URL of the current page.

#+NAME: hell-url
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(defparenstatic hello-url
    (defun set-body (text)
      (setf (ps:chain document body inner-text) text)
      ;; return nil to avoid json decode errors
      nil)
  (set-body (ps:chain document -u-r-l)))
#+END_SRC

Defparenstatic will automatically generate a defparameter named
~hello-url~ as in the case above, and a function ~(hello-url)~ that
you can invoke to act upon the currently ~*active-buffer*~.
