* Next platform ports

Next is made of two programs:

- The Lisp core which offers the user full control over the browsing.  It's 100%
  Common Lisp.

- The "platform port", which only purpose is to display a window with two
  components: the minibuffer and the web view.

The two parts communicate via [[http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/][XML-RPC]].  The Lisp core sends an XML-RPC request
to the port (for example, "open this URL"); the port acts upon it and sends an
XML-RPC response back to the Lisp core.

The communication API is fully specified in =remote.lisp=, which is in the Lisp
core source.

This folder contains the different ports.  They are all independent and target
various platforms.
