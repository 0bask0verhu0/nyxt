* nEXT Browser
nEXT is the fastest productivity browser. It is designed from the
ground up to be customizable for your workflow. nEXT Browser is the
infinitely EXTensible browser.

* Powerful Features
** Fast tab switching
Switch easily between your open tabs by fuzzy search. If you are
looking for ~http://www.example.com~, you could type in ~ele~, ~exa~,
~epl~, and any other valid series of letters. In a future release,
typing any semantically related word will give you a fuzzy search of
your open tabs and let you quickly find which page you were looking
for.

** History as a tree
History is represented as a tree that you can traverse. More complex
than the "forwards-backwards" abstraction found in other browsers,
the tree makes sure you never lose track of where you've been.

In the example below, the User performs the following actions:

1. Starts page ~Athens~
2. Visits page ~Ancient Greek~
3. Returns to page ~Athens~
4. Visits page ~Classical Athens~
5. Returns to page ~Athens~
6. Executes ~forwards~ keybind in history

It is at this point that a normal browser would NOT be able to
navigate you forwards to your visit of ~Ancient Greek~. Instead of
erasing your history, nEXT offers smart navigation and prompts the
user. Do you wish to go forwards to ~Ancient Greek~ or to
~Classical Athens~?
