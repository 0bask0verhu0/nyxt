* Next Web Browser
Next is a keyboard-oriented, extensible web-browser designed for power
users. The application has familiar key-bindings, is fully
configurable and extensible in Lisp, and has powerful features for
productive professionals.

*Warning:* Next is under active development.  Feel free to [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/issues][report]] bugs,
instabilities or feature wishes.

* Features
Next includes many features designed to enable you to focus on being
productive. A few of them are demonstrated below.

** Fast tab switching
Switch easily between your open tabs by fuzzy search. If you are
looking for ~https://www.example.com~, you could type in ~ele~, ~exa~,
~epl~, and any other valid series of letters.

** History as a tree
History is represented as a tree that you can traverse. More complex
than the "forwards-backwards" abstraction found in other browsers,
the tree makes sure you never lose track of where you've been.

In the example below, the User performs the following actions:

1. Starts page ~True Parrot~
2. Visits page ~Gray Parrot~
3. Returns to page ~True Parrot~
4. Visits page ~Budgerigar~
5. Returns to page ~True Parrot~
6. Executes ~forwards~ keybind in history

It is at this point that a normal browser would NOT be able to
navigate you forwards to your visit of ~Gray Parrot~. Instead of
erasing your history, Next offers smart navigation and prompts the
user. Do you wish to go forwards to ~Gray Parrot~ or to
~Budgerigar~?

** Lightning fast navigation
Next is lightweight and fast. The interface does not get in your way,
and everything can be done by keyboard. You are free to fully focus on
your task unburdened by cumbersome UI.

Link Hints provide you with the ability to instantly jump to any link
on the page, or even open it in a new tab.

Fuzzy completion means intelligent completion. Find your bookmarks,
open up new links, or switch tabs with the power of fuzzy completion.

* Getting Started
** Install Next
See the [[https://next.atlas.engineer/download][downloads]] page for pre-built binaries. Some operating systems
provide packages for Next:

- [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/next-browser-git/][Arch Linux AUR]]
- [[https://guix.info][Guix]]: Install with =guix package --install sbcl-next=.

Guix is a package manager that can be installed on any GNU/Linux distribution;
should Next be missing from your distribution, there is always the possibility
to install Guix on your system and use it to install Next.

- If Guix is easily available for your distribution (e.g. as a package), then
  this is definitely the simplest route.

- If not, or if you want to help developing Next, then building from source is
  the commended route.

To perform an installation from source, please see the [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/tree/master/documents][developer readme]].

** Quickstart Keys
- ~C-l~:     Load URL in tab
- ~M-l~:     Load URL in a new tab
- ~C-x b~:   Switch tab
- ~C-b~:     Backwards history
- ~C-f~:     Forwards history
- ~C-x C-c~: Quit

The following keys exist as special keys:

1. ~C~: Control Key
2. ~S~: Super (Windows key, Command Key)
3. ~M~: Meta (Alt key, Option Key)

** Customize and Extend Next
Customization is possible through the creation of a
=~/.config/next/init.lisp= file. From here you
can override and redefine any of the functions by defining your init
file as part of the ~:next~ package. For more information please see:
[[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/blob/master/documents/MANUAL.org#customization][customizing Next]].

Additionally, a document provided in the documents directory named
[[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/blob/master/documents/EXTENSION.org][EXTENSION.org]] is a place for the community to share helpful
customizations. To share your own extension, please make a pull
request with your new extension appended to EXTENSION.org.

** Documentation
For full documentation about Next, how it works, and how to extend it
please see the [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/blob/master/documents/MANUAL.org][user manual]].
