* nEXT Browser
nEXT is the fastest productivity browser. It is designed from the
ground up to be customizable for your workflow. nEXT Browser is the
infinitely EXTensible browser.

* Powerful Features
** History as a tree
History is represented as a tree that you can traverse. More complex
than the "forwards-backwards" abstraction found in other browsers,
the tree makes sure you never lose track of where you've been.
** Fast tab switching
Switch easily between your open tabs by keyword, thumbnail, or by URL.
Typing any semantically related word will give you a fuzzy search of
your open tabs and let you quickly find which page you were looking
for.

* Getting Started
** Install nEXT Browser
See the releases section for pre-built binary releases.
** Quickstart Keys nEXT
- ~C-l~:     Load URL in Buffer
- ~S-l~:     Load URL in a new buffer
- ~C-c C-X~: Quit

** Customize nEXT
Customization is possible through the creation of a
=~/.next.d/init.lisp= file within your home directory. From here you
can override and redefine any of the functions by defining your init
file as part of the ~:next~ package.

For full documentation about nEXT, how it works, and how to extend it
please see the ~documents/MANUAL.org~ file.
