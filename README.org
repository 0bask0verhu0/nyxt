* Next web browser

Next is a keyboard-oriented, extensible web-browser designed for power
users. It has familiar key-bindings ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs][Emacs]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)][VI]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Common_User_Access][CUA]]), is fully
configurable and extensible in Lisp, and has powerful features for
productive professionals.

If you like Next and if you want to help future development, please

*Warning:* Next is under active development. Feel free to [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/issues][report]] bugs,

** Fast tab switching
Switch easily between your open tabs via fuzzy search. If you are
looking for ~https://www.example.com~, you could type in ~ele~, ~exa~,
~epl~, or any other matching series of letters.

** Multiple selection
Commands can accept multiple inputs, allowing you to quickly perform
an operation against multiple objects. In the example below we search
for penguins, and only open up links that have the text "animal"
within them.

** Powerful Bookmarks
Bookmark a page with tags. Search bookmarks with compound
queries. Capture more data about your bookmarks, and group and wrangle
them in any way you like.

** History as a tree
History is represented as a tree that you can traverse. smarter than
the "forwards-backwards" abstraction found in other browsers, the tree
makes sure  you never lose  track of where  you've been.
