Usage:

   make next-cocoa  Create Next with the Cocoa port.
   make next-gtk    Create Next with the GTK port.
   make install     Install the GTK port.  Set DESTDIR to
                      change the target destinatation.

Set LISP and LISP_FLAGS to accommodate to your Lisp compiler.

If NEXT_INTERNAL_QUICKLISP is "true" (the default), all Lisp
dependencies will be fetched with Quicklisp into the
QUICKLISP_DIR directory.

Otherwise, the dependencies will have to be locally installed
on your system.  You might have to accomodate the LISP_FLAGS
to, say, use your local install of Quicklisp.  For instance

   make next-gtk NEXT_INTERNAL_QUICKLISP=false LISP_FLAGS=--non-interactive
