Usage:

    make all                 # Create Nyxt.
    make install             # Install Nyxt.
    make doc                 # Generate Nyxt documentation (as a fallback).

DESTDIR and PREFIX set the target destination.  Both must be absolute paths.

NASDF_SOURCE_PATH sets where the source files will be installed.

NASDF_TESTS_NO_NETWORK disables tests that require networking.

When NYXT_SUBMODULES is "true" (the default), all Lisp dependencies are fetched
as git submodules to the directory set by NASDF_SUBMODULES_DIR.  Otherwise, they
need to be made visible to ASDF by other means.  In case you have received an
archive that includes the source of these Lisp dependencies, then it all should
work out of the box.

NYXT_RENDERER sets the renderer, by default "gi-gtk".

NYXT_VERSION forces the version number, in the rare eventuality that it can't be
fetched in another way.

The static documentation is particularly useful when it can't be consulted from
Nyxt itself (where it is dynamically generated at runtime).
